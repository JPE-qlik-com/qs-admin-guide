# Optimize Sheet Order for Adoption <i class="fas fa-dolly-flatbed fa-xs" title="Shipped | Native Capability"></i>

## Goal

Many times when an application is being developed there is an assumption that the sheets were properly ordered, based in a story of the application data. It is always a good practice to check the user adoption of the sheets and, reorder them to increase adoption rates and BI effectiveness.

## Operations Monitor - Analyze Aplication Sheet Adopion  <i class="fas fa-dolly-flatbed fa-xs" title="Shipped | Native Capability"></i>

It is possible to check the application's sheets usage using the Operations Monitor App.

In the Monitoring Apps stream, select **Operations Monitor**:

Inside the Operations Monitor application there is a dedicated sheet to do the sheet usage analysis:

Inside the **Sheet Usage** sheet you will be able to see all sheets across all the applications, for this example I will select an application named "Sample App":

Now we can see all the sheets (Base Sheets, Community Sheets and Private Sheets) that we have inside the "Sample App" application.

You can notice that the usage order would be:

Order | Sheet Name
------|--------------------------------
1     | Dashboard
2     | Inventory
2     | Sales Analysis by Region
3     | Expansion Analysis
4     | DSO

-------------------------

## Reorder Application Sheet

If we open the published "Sample App" application we can see that the original order do not correspod with the usage.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption05.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption05.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption05.png)

To change that order by defaut the application owner should clone the "Sample App".

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption06.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption06.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption06.png)

As soon as the application gets duplicated it will be at Personal > Work area. Now we can edit the Base Sheets order.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption07.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption07.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption07.png)

As soon as the application is open, make sure that the "Touch screen mode" feature is turned off.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption08.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption08.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption08.png)

To move sheets we just need to drag and drop them to the desired order. In this case I will make sheet "Sales Analytis by Region" the second sheet.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption09.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption09.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption09.png)

And the "Inventory" sheet the third sheet.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption10.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption10.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption10.png)

Now the application sheet order is compliant with the usage data.

[![optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption11.png](images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption11.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qs-admin-guide/qs-admin-guide/master/docs/asset_management/apps/images/optimize_sheet_order_for_adoption11.png)

The "Sample App" now should be republished, replacing the old version.
