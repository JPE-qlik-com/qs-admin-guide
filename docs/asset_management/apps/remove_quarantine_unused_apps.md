## Process

For this task, we will use the Operations Monitor application. Make sure this application is currently being reloaded each day. If you are having issues with this reload or the application settings, please refer to [Operations Monitor - Help Site](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-admin/Subsystems/DeployAdministerQSE/Content/Sense_DeployAdminister/QSEoW/Administer_QSEoW/Monitoring_QSEoW/Operations-monitor-app.htm) for descriptions and troubleshooting of the app.	

1. Open the Operations Monitor App
2. Select the "Apps" sheet

3. In the App Details table object, sort by Last Accessed field and scroll to old dates or null dates

### Priority 1
    
Look for applications that are Published but have not been accessed. This can be quickly filtered to by selecting _Unpublished_ from the **Stream** column, and then by selecting _Select alternative_ to view all published applications.

### Priority 2

## Actions
    
    1. If you don't already have a stream named "Quarantine", this is a good time to create one. Ideally, the stream should be walled off to only Content Admins or the like, where they can review the applications with their respective owners.

    2. Contact the application owners to let them know you are moving their app(s) to Quarantine.	

    3. Move the applications from Priorities 1, 2, and 3 to the Quarantine Stream

    4. Any applications that have been in the Quarantine stream for X number of days can be removed (corporate policy on how long they should be kept.) It is considered a best practice to export them without data, at a minimum--potentially exported with data if the intent is to archive them.
